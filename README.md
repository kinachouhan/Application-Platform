Cargofirst Job Portal

Cargofirst is a comprehensive job portal designed to connect companies and job seekers in a seamless and efficient way. Companies can register on the platform, create, edit, and delete job postings, view applicants for each job, and select or reject candidates, all from a user-friendly dashboard. Job seekers can browse all active job listings, apply for jobs through a popup or modal form, and include their name, email, optional resume link, and a short cover note when applying. The system ensures that deleted jobs are no longer visible to customers, keeping job listings accurate and up to date. The platform also provides clear status indicators for applications, allowing candidates to see whether their application is pending, selected, or rejected. Built with a modern tech stack including React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, Cargofirst offers a responsive and engaging experience for both desktop and mobile users. With secure authentication, role-based access, and an intuitive interface, it simplifies recruitment for companies while providing a smooth and transparent experience for job seekers.
